In the Philippines, there is an event that is almost synonymous to the month of December, and that is the release of Spotify Wrapped. There might be another important holiday called Christmas or something.

Anyway, part of the Spotify Wrapped charts is the "**Top Tracks of 2025 Philippines**" which presents the 50 most listened songs by Spotify users in the Philippines. It included both OPM and international songs. While it does not present a complete picture of the Filipinos' listening habits, it can provide a glimpse of what's popular in the country.

## <u>Quick Overview</u>

Out of the 50 songs in the list, 39 are OPM songs, while 11 are from international artists. This highlights the still healthy music scene in the Philippines, and its continued appreciation by the Filipino community.

Cup of Joe's viral song *Multo* topped the charts with the rest of the Top 5 tracks being all OPM songs. Earl Agustin's *Tibok* got the Top 2 spot. Another song from his 2025 debut album *Himig at Pag-ibig*, *Dalangin* at 19th, also entered the Top 50 list. Dionela continued his presence in the Top 5 listened songs in the Philippines with *Marilag* at 3rd. Amiel Sol and HELLMERRY also had their Top 50 Tracks debut with *Sa Bawat Sandali* (4th) and *My Day* (5th), respectively.

The bands and artists that dominated the Top 50 tracks are Cup of Joe (with 4 songs), Arthur Nery (4 songs), Dionela (3 songs) and December Avenue (3 songs).

## <u>Moving on...</u>

One of the interesting things about the 2025 list was the absence of some of the artists that dominated last year's Top 50. Hev Abi, which was either the main or a collaborating artist for 9 tracks in the 2024 list, does not have any song in this year's Top 50. Another surprising absence this year is BINI (4 songs in 2024 list).

This change in music landscape was not limited to local artists. Sabrina Carpenter and Ariana Grande, which both have 2 songs in the 2024 list, were not present this year.

While some artists and songs failed to get a slot in this year's list, some songs seemed to never die. Up Dharma Down's *Tadhana* and *Unti-Unti*, as well as *The Man Who Can't Be Moved* by The Script, are still part of the Top 50 most listened songs in the Philippines, as they always do in the past few years. This proves the old saying:

> Di mo matatakasan ang *Tadhana*.

## <u>When The Past Found The Present</u>

Another interesting stats about the 2025 Top 50 list is the distribution of the tracks' release dates.

<BlogPostImage src={release_date} alt='Release dates of tracks in 2024 and 2025 Top Tracks Philippines' caption='Release dates of tracks in 2024 and 2025 Top Tracks Philippines. Colored boxes were plotted to indicate the 3-year periods before the release of the 2024 (red) and 2025 (blue) Spotify Wrapped charts.'/>

There are more older songs in the 2025 list as compared to the previous year's release. Just to put it into perspective, for the 2024 Top Tracks, 38 songs have release dates within 3 years before the 2024 report. This number is only 26 for the 2025 counterpart.

There are also more much-older songs in the 2025 charts. An example of this is the 1998 song *Iris* of the The Goo Goo Dolls. For the local scene, Sugarfree's *Burnout* (2003) and Soapdish's *Tensionado* (2005) are just few of the old songs included in the 2025 list.

This factoid highlights the unpredictability of social media, and how it can facilitate the rediscovery of old songs and other cultural pieces of the past.

## <u>Minumulto ng Damdamin</u>

To facilitate music recommendation, Spotify computes certain metrics/features. Some of those metrics are directly computed from the audio data, while some are estimated using machine learning models.

With that said, before I continue, I would like to explain briefly some of those metrics:
- Tempo: Estimated speed or pace of the track measured in beats per minute

- Acousticness: Confidence measure that the track is acoustic. Synth music, for example, should have low acousticness values.

- Danceability: How danceable the song is based on tempo, rhythm stability etc.

- Valence: How positive the track sounds. Happy- or cheerful-sounding songs should have high valence, while sad- or angsty-sounding songs should have low valence. The track's actual lyrics is not considered for this metric, so high valence songs with actually sad lyrics can exist, and vice versa.

With those terms' definitions out of the way, let's go back to the charts.

<BlogPostImage src={valence_acoustic} alt='Valence and acousticness values of each track.' caption='Valence and acousticness values of each track. Blue (red) dashed line shows the average value for the 2025 (2024) Top 50 tracks.'/>

There is a clear difference in average valence values between the 2024 and 2025 Top 50 lists. There is also a smaller difference in acousticness.

The change in valence can be attributed to the absence of BINI and Hev Abi. Their songs tend to have high valence and low acousticness, with BINI being known for their feel-good pop songs.

There are also more songs in the 2025 list that has middling values for acousticness. Among the Top 5 songs, *Multo*, *Marilag*, *Bawat Sandali*, and *My Day* are within this range. Most of the Cup of Joe's songs are also within this range of acousticness, with their songs having both acoustic and synth accompaniment.

<BlogPostImage src={dance_tempo} alt='Danceability and tempo values of each track.' caption='Danceability and tempo values of each track. Blue (red) dashed line shows the average value for the 2025 (2024) Top 50 tracks.'/>

Average tempo of songs in the 2025 chart is a bit higher than its 2024 counterpart. A very good example of this is the top song, *Multo*, which has a tempo of 208 BPM. Furthermore, while the 2024 Top 50 songs has a clear mode in the tempo values around 120 BPM, more of the 2025 Top 50 songs have tempo of around 130-140 BPM.

Danceability is also lower for the 2025 Top 50 songs, albeit much less significant than for the other metrics discussed. This can be attributed to the lack of high danceability tracks (e.g. BINI and Hev Abi songs for the 2024 list).

## <u>Spotify Wrapped Wrapped</u>

The Top Tracks of 2025 Philippines came out this month, and showed the dynamic nature of the music landscape. Some of the artists that dominated last year's charts are absent, while some artists debuted in this year's list. Many old songs were also rediscovered this year, and are able to enter the Top 50 list.

The change in the songs and artists on the list also reflected on the general characteristics in terms of audio features/metrics. The cheerful (high valence) sounds that dominated last year's chart is replaced by heartfelt love songs.

This year's chart really showed that people's taste in music changes through time. It shows that we can move on from our beloved songs, in the same way that we move on from those we used to love, often with the help of the aforementioned songs.

Except for *Tadhana* and *The Man Who Can't Be Moved*, I guess.
