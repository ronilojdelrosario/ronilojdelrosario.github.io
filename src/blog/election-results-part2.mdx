The 2025 Senation election period came and went. Allies became enemies, and enemies became allies. Frontrunners fell behind, while dark horses found victory. As the dust settled, what lies in its wake is a political landscape forever changed.

To have a clearer view of what happened, I looked at the data, and I discovered that...

Meh.

Most of the patterns in the data were somewhat expected leading to the elections. But as random tumblr users and pinterest girlies say:

## <u>Election Abridged</u>

Let's first see the national results.

<BlogPostImage src={results_national} alt='National senatorial election results' caption='National senatorial election results'/>

One of the highlights of the recent senate election were the good results achieved by the Duterte slate. Bong Go, Bato Dela Rosa, and Rodante Marcoleta was able to win senate seats, with Bong Go getting the most votes among the senatoriables. This, however, was already foreshadowed by their increasing performance in polls right before the election.

The thing no one expected, however, were the number of votes obtained by the dynamic senator duo, with Bam Aquino having the 2nd most votes and Kiko Pangilinan being 5th.

Speaking of senator duo, many were blindsided by the heel turn of Imee Marcos and Camille Villar after the arrest of Former President Duterte, few months before the election. Both of them would later win senate seats.

Another notable result was the poor performance of Benhur Abalos, one of the admin's favorite candidate.

## <u>Solid North vs Solid-er South</u>

A narrative that shaped the political climate months before the election was the seeming divide between Luzon and Mindanao. Fueled by the decades-long neglect from the "Imperial Manila", many people from Mindanao felt that this election was the opportunity to express their frustrations. This divide was further deepened by the recent arrest of Former President Duterte.

If I learned something from Game of Thrones, it was that regional divide between north and south may cause great shifts in political power #BringNedStarkHome. And that you should not climb windows without a harness. Anyway, let's see how provinces voted during the last election.

<BlogPostImage src={top12_per_province} alt='Percent of votes per province (Top 12)' caption='Percent of votes per province for the winning senatoriables'/>

The Greater Manila vs Mindanao divide was very evident in the plot above. The Duterte slate (Bong Go, Bato, Marcoleta) got large number of votes in the provinces within Mindanao (represented by brownish red to purple dots) and in Visayas (lighter brown dots) to some extent, and relatively less votes in Luzon (represented by blue and green dots). Meanwhile, the admin slate (Tulfo, Lacson, Sotto, Cayetano, Lapid), as well as the dynamic duo of Bam and Kiko, got less votes in Mindanao and relatively higher votes in the Luzon and Region 6/Western Visayas (brown dots). The only exception to this for the admin slate was the province of Camiguin in Mindanao, wherein many admin bets got their highest vote percentages.

Just to highlight this pattern more, we can look at the difference between the vote percentages of the admin slate vs the Duter10 slate.

<BlogPostImage src={results_admin} alt='Percent of votes per province (Admin Slate)' caption='Percent of votes per province for the admin-backed senatoriables'/>

Again, the highest red dot for almost all admin bets (except for Pacquiao) represents the province of Camiguin. Looking at the results in Camiguin, Bong Go and Bato got the highest votes but the rest of the Top 12 in the province were from the admin slate, along with the Imee-Villar duo. Aside from Camiguin, the admin slate was also able to get high votes in Misamis Occidental, another Northern Mindanao province. However, the admin slate, on average, failed to get high vote percentages in the rest of the Mindanao provinces, with BARMM and Davao provinces corresponding to the least percentage of votes.

It is also important to note that regional differences in votes also exist within the admin slate. Candidates that were more linked to President Marcos, like Tulfo and Abalos, were able to get relatively high votes in Region 1. Some of the candidates associated to showbiz, i.e. Bong Revilla, Lito Lapid and Manny Pacquiao, failed to get high votes in NCR. Lastly, Francis Tolentino also exists if ever you forgot (not saying I did).

<BlogPostImage src={results_duter10} alt='Percent of votes per province (Duter10)' caption='Percent of votes per province for the Duterte-backed senatoriables'/>

The Duter10 slate consistently got high votes in Mindanao provinces. The lowest vote percentages, perhaps, were for Doc Mata, but his percentages in Mindanao were still higher, on average, compared to the admin-backed candidates. However, the Duterte-backed candidates got very low votes in most of the other provinces, with the exception of the three winning senatoriables. Bong Go, Bato Dela Rosa and Marcoleta Rodante were able to get enough votes, and even high number of votes for the case of Bong Go, in the other parts of the country to propel them to win senate seats.

Let's talk about specific senators...

## <u>Special Awardees</u>

<BlogPostImage src={results_bong_go} alt='Percent of votes per province (Bong Go)' caption='Percent of votes per province (Bong Go)'/>

Let's start with Bong Go which got the 1st place in the senatorial election. While Bong Go got extremely high votes in Mindanao, he also got high number of votes (above 30%) in most of the other provinces. Focusing in the Greater Manila area, it was only Bam Aquino that consistently got higher votes than Go. However, Go got low votes in some provinces in Bicol, Ilocos Region, and CAR. Overall, it was clear that Bong Go has a general national appeal, except for the strongholds of the administration (Northern Luzon) and opposition (some areas in Bicol). This can be attributed to the Malasakit Centers which is Bong Go's most popular project and his number 1 advocacy during the campaign period.

<BlogPostImage src={results_bam_kiko} alt='Percent of votes per province (Bam and Kiko)' caption='Percent of votes per province (Bam and Kiko)'/>

The "Most Improved Award" will be given to the dynamic duo of Bam Aquino amd Kiko Pangilinan. They were heavily helped by votes from NCR and provinces in the southern half of Luzon (light blue dots, Region 3, to very light green dots, Region 5 or Bicol Region). These provinces have high population, hence high number of voters, which led to their good national rankings. They both got low votes in Mindanao and a-bit-lower votes in the administration's strongholds in North Luzon. Bam Aquino got the highest percentage of votes in Tarlac, which is a known Aquino bulwark. Meanwhile, Kiko Pangilinan got the highest percentage of votes in Samar, wherein he got the local officials' endorsements. This highlights that even in closely-linked campaigns, the Philippine brand of regionalism still affect election results.

<BlogPostImage src={results_cam_imee} alt='Percent of votes per province (Camille Villar and Imee Marcos)' caption='Percent of votes per province (Camille Villar and Imee Marcos)'/>

The "Plot Twist of the Season Award" will be given to the admin bets turned critics, Camille Villar and Imee Marcos. They received comparable percentage of votes between Greater Manila and Mindanao provinces. Compare this to the other winning senatoriables which achieved contrasting results between Greater Manila and Mindanao. This somewhat showed that, although Mindanao did not view the Plot Twist Duo as part of the admin slate, they also did not view them as part of the Duterte senatorial bets. The Floater Duo also got high votes in some provinces in Zamboanga Region. As usual, regional variations in election support played its part. Imee Marcos achieved high vote percentages in the Solid North provinces, but low vote percentages in several Bicol regions.

## <u>Almost chosen. Almost loved.</u>

To cap off this blog post, I would like to present the 13th to 24th placer in the recent senatorial election.

<BlogPostImage src={next12_per_province} alt='Percent of votes per province (13-24)' caption='Percent of votes per province for 13th-24th placers'/>

Since the admin bets and Duter10 candidates were already discussed above, let's focus on the indepedents. Ben Tulfo, perhaps due to his association with his brother Erwin Tulfo, presents similar voter pattern as the admin-backed senatoriables of low votes in Mindanao and high percentages in Luzon.

The other two independents, Bosita Colonel and Heidi Mendoza, got consistently low votes, especially in Mindanao provinces. The only exception to this were the NCR and Calabarzon areas where they got relatively high votes. Comparing to the other candidates in the 13th-24th rank list, they even got higher vote percentages, on average, in these areas.

## <u>Moral of the story</u>

So what did the results tell us about our country?

It was clear that Mindanao wants their voice to be heard. The recent divide between President Marcos and the Dutertes might have aggravated the issue, but it's clear that the problem was already brewing for years. The "either you're with us or against us" stance that Mindanao projected during the last election did not just hit the admin-backed candidates but also the independents.
